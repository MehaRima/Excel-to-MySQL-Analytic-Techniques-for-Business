True/False: Student A sampled 100 times from a population with sample size n = 25; student B sampled 100 times from the SAME population using sample size n = 50. The sample means that student A and student B get will both follow Gaussian distributions, and have approximately equal means.

Given ordered data sets X = {12, 23, 4, 36, 10, 67, 58, 40, 33} and Y = {1.5, 10, 8.3, 4, 1.4, 1.8, 2.2, 4, 3} What is the correlation of their ordered pairs after standardization?

Refer to the raw data in the Correlation with Standardization spreadsheet, 5-6.

Imagine a scatter plot of RSP against SPY monthly returns for the twelve years from May 2003 to May 2015. Now, imagine that you standardize the monthly returns for both RSP and SPY and generate a second scatter plot of the standardized ordered pairs.

Which of the five items below must be the same for both scatter plots? – choose all that apply
