1. 
A test for “driving while intoxicated” was given 100 times. 20 people tested were actually intoxicated, and 10 people were mis-classified as intoxicated. What would the false positive rate be?

50% x

30% x

12.5% v

10%

2. 
If a fire alarm malfunctions and fails to go off when there actually is a fire, that is a:

False Positive x

False Negative v

True Positive

True Negative x

3. 
If the “classification incidence/test incidence” is 10% and the true “condition incidence” is 12%, the true positive rate:

must be 100%

can be 100%

cannot be 100% v

must be 0%

4. 
Use the Protein Level/Cancer Diagnostic data in Spreadsheets 3-3C "Cost Varying Threshold" to answer Questions 4 to 7:

Question 4: Is there a threshold value for the quantity of diagnostic marker protein X37 that, at the given costs per FN of $50,000 and cost per FP of $500, results in a lower cost per test than $124 (round to the nearest dollar)?

Yes v

No

5. 
If Yes in Question 4, what is the minimum cost per test (rounded to the nearest dollar)?

No, $124 is the minimum x

$118 x

$120 v

$121

6. 
What is the lowest threshold value classified as “Positive” that achieves the optimal cost per test?

16539.5 x

16541.3 x

16551.9 v

16552.9

7. 
In general, increasing the cost per FN while keeping the cost per FP constant will cause the cost-minimizing threshold score to:

Increase x

Decrease v

Stay the Same

8. 
Make a copy of the Excel Bombers and Seagulls spreadsheet 3-1, 3-3A, 3-4 to answer Questions 8 to 10:

Modify the spreadsheet data so that there are 4 bombers instead of 3 – with the 4th bomber having score 66 – and 16 seagulls instead of 17.

What is the new Area Under the Curve:

0.72 x

0.75 v

0.78

0.80

9. 
What is the new minimum cost per event?

1.20 Million pounds x

1.30 Million pounds x

1.40 Million pounds v

1.50 Million pounds

10. 
What is the new threshold that minimizes the cost per event?

62 x

66 v

70

74

11. 
A population tested for “driving while intoxicated” has a Condition incidence of 20%. If the test has a true positive rate of 70% and a false positive rate of 10%, what is the test’s Positive Predictive Value (PPV)?

0.36 x

0.50 x

0.60

0.64 v

12. 
In the example from the video of adding standardized heights and standardized weights, what is the False Positive rate if we choose a threshold between -1.33 and -1.28?



0.6 v

0.67

0.4

0.33
