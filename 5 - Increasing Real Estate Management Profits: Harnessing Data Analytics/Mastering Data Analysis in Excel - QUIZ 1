Please use the following information to answer all questions in this quiz.

Refer to the Excel Essentials for Beginners Solutions Workbook sheet 2S-10 that contain the monthly continuously compounded returns for two stock indexes – RSP and SPY – and two individual stocks – Amazon and Duke Energy – for the 12 years from May 2003 to May 2015.

Use Excel’s chart function to generate a scatter plot of SPY index monthly returns (y axis) against Amazon monthly returns (x axis)

When you use “trendline” option for slope, R-squared, and the y-intercept, double-check your results against the equivalent cell formula answers.

Question 1: What is the slope of the best-fit line (rounded to two decimal places)?

0.11 X

0.12 X

0.15 V

0.18

2. 
What is the coefficient of determination (R-squared)? Use the "rsq" Excel function (Trendline in Excel may give an inaccurate value for R-squared).

0.18 V

0.20

0.22

0.24

3. 
What is the Y-intercept, in percent? Use the "trendline" but double-check against the "intercept" function.

0.25% X

0.35% X

0.45% V

0.55%

4. 
Answer Question 4 and 5 based on the information below:

The annual Sharpe Ratio (discussed extensively in Course 1) calculates the difference between the annual return of a stock and the annual return of a risk-free investment in government bonds - then divides that difference by the annualized standard deviation of returns of the stock.

Estimate the annualized standard deviation of returns by multiplying the monthly population standard deviation of returns by the square root of 12.

Question 4: Assuming the risk-free rate is 1.5% per year over the full 12-year interval measured, which asset had the higher Sharpe ratio: SPY or RSP?

SPY X

RSP V

5. 
For the asset you chose in Question 4, what was the Sharpe ratio? Round your results to two decimal places.

0.56 X

0.53 V

0.50

0.48

6. 
In the month ending on which date did Amazon achieve the highest returns?

September 1, 2010 X

October 1, 2009  X

What was the monthly return from the question above?

22.9% X

24.11% X

43.27% V

51.87%

8. 
What was Duke Energy’s return that same month?

0.51% X

1.13% V

3.04%

3.18%

9. 
Using the Solver plug-in for Excel, answer Questions 9 and 10, based on the information below:

Between possible pricing of $5 per pound to $25 per pound, the quantity of coffee Egger’s Roast Coffee can sell each month is a linear function of the retail selling price per pound. The linear function is (quantity sold in pounds) = (-400*(Price per pound)) + 10,000.

Question 9: What is the revenue-maximizing selling price per pound for Egger’s Roast Coffee?

(If you find solver hard to comprehend, here is one sample of the same question but with different numbers)

$5.00 X

$12.50 V

$13.50

$25.00

10. 
What is the monthly revenue at that price per pound? ( , indicates thousands)

$15,100 X

$62,500 V

$62,100

$40,000
