6. 
True/False: In a scatterplot of 100 ordered pairs drawn from two Gaussian random variables with mean = 0, variance = 1, and correlation R = 0, it is possible to get a correlation of the ordered pairs = 0.99.

True v

False
7. 
Which of the following statements about over-fitting is false:

Over-fitting occurs when we model "noise" along with or instead of a true relationship.

Over-fitting leads to overconfidence in our model.

The more complex the model, the less  likely over-fitting is to occur. v

In order to avoid over-fitting, it is necessary to test the model on new data.
